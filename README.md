# Exemplary local kubernetes CI/CD workflow with tekton

In this repo we are creating a classical CI/CD workflow from scratch, that can be reproduced entirely locally. 

We will employ [minikube](https://kubernetes.io/de/docs/tasks/tools/install-minikube/)
to set up a basic [kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io) cluster that is able to execute [tekton](https://tekton.dev) pipelines and employ event listeners with interceptors.
Subsequently we build a tekton pipeline performing the following tasks:
- cloning a public GitHub repository containing a docker file
- building a deployable docker image and storing its .tar file in a local registry (no need to push to docker hub)
-  create a pod on our kubernetes cluster that runs the container as a k8s job

This pipeline runs fully automated and is triggered by a Tekton EventListener
listening to a webhook of the GitHub repository. The webhook will trigger the EventListener
with every push of code to the repository.

## Setup Cluster

First of all fill out the template_env.env form and rename it to .env, this will load your environment variables for the next steps.

Make sure to have [minikube](https://kubernetes.io/de/docs/tasks/tools/install-minikube/)
installed and the docker daemon running.

Now we set up our k8s cluster
```shell
bash scripts/setup_cluster.sh
```
This script sets up the local storage structure, starts minikube, mounts the volumes and configures Tekton to employ pipelines, EventListeners and interceptors.

After execution check if all the pods are running before going to the next step via
```bash
kubectl get pods -A
```

## Setup Pipeline

Now that our cluster is successfully configured, we set up the actual CI/CD pipeline.
For that execute
```bash
bash scripts/setup_ci-cd_pipeline.sh
```
This sets up the correct permissions within the cluster, defines a service for the event listener, registers all the tasks present in our pipline and composes the pipeline.
It additionally sets up the triggering, by defining the trigger and setting up an Eventlistener who will listen to the exposed `localhost:8080`.

## Setup Networking

So now our eventlistener will be recognizing all traffic posted to `localhost:8080`
However the trigger (especially `pipelines/ci-cd/trigger-binding.yaml`) requires the json body to contain certain fields emitted by a GitHub webhook.
So in order to chain our pipeline to a webhook we first need a way to send actual traffic to
`localhost:8080`, which is achieved via [ngrok](https://ngrok.com).

Invoking
```bash
ngrok http localhost:8080
```

will provide us with a link that can be passed to the github webhook.

## Setup Repository

Now the final step is to setup a GitHub repository.
Therefore we provide a simple repository containing a simple python package which reads a file 
from an ingress folder. We also provide a dockerfile for deployment.

So simply create a public GitHub repo with the content of the read-file folder.
Now in the GitHub options of the repo paste the link provided by `ngrok` and make sure to set the
content type to `application/json`.

## Triggering the pipeline

Now that everything is setup we can see our CI/CD pipeline in action.
Modify the README.md of the read-file repo locally and push it.

Now monitor your kubernetes cluster via
```bash
kubectl get pods -A
```

You should see the pods appearing corresponding to the tasks contained in the pipeline, so e.g.
`ci-cd-vjnsn-fetch-source-pod`

If everything goes through, after a good minute you should see a pod `bellatrix-deployment-<id>`
Now log this pod via
```bash
kubectl logs bellatrix-deployment-<id>
```
and you will see the output `Hello from image` which is exactly the content from the mounted `.txt`.ðŸ™Œ

## Debugging

Useful commands for logging into your pods are
```bash
# display log
kubectl logs <your pod>
#get full info abount the pod
kubectl describe pod <your pod>
```
It can be also very beneficial to log the EventListener service `el-github-listener-<id>`.

Furthermore you can look into your pipeline runs via tekton
```bash
# get an overview over pipelineruns
kubectl get pipelineruns
# get the log of a specific pipelinerun
tkn pipelinerun logs <pipelinerun>
```
